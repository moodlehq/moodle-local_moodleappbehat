      | Test assignment name  | student1  | I'm the student first submission   |
    And I am on the "Test assignment name" Activity page logged in as teacher1
    And I go to "Student 1" "Test assignment name" activity advanced grading page
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Grade out of 100      | 50 |
      | Notify student        | 0  |
    And I press "Save changes"
    And I log out

 Scenario: View gradebook with grade penalties on a phone
    Given I entered the course "Course 1" as "student1" in the app
    When I press "Grades" in the app
    And I press "Test assignment name" in the app
    Then I should find "Late penalty applied -10.00 marks" within "Test assignment name" "tr" in the app

 Scenario: View gradebook with grade penalties on a tablet
    Given I entered the course "Course 1" as "student1" in the app
    And I change viewport size to "1200x640" in the app
    When I press "Grades" in the app
    Then I should find "Late penalty applied -10.00 marks" within "Test assignment name" "tr" in the app
