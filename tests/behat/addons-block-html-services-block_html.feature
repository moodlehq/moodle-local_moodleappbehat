  Scenario: View and navigate the html block in a course
    Given I entered the course "Course 1" as "student1" in the app
    When I press "Open block drawer" in the app
    Then I should find "HTML title test" in the app
    Then I should find "body test" in the app

    # Add another block just to ensure there is something in the block region and the drawer is displayed.
    Given the following "blocks" exist:

    And  I entered the course "Course 1" as "student1" in the app
